# 👋 Hi, I'm Talabi Micheal

I’m a full-stack developer with a strong focus on backend engineering and a growing passion for building clean, reliable, and user-focused web applications.  
I enjoy connecting ideas with technology and creating systems that actually work for people.

💡 I’m currently working on **Financial Modelling Prep**, a project that automates complex financial modeling workflows.  
I also built **Bebbah Radio**, a live streaming and ticket-selling app that allows creators, event hosts, and actors to collaborate and connect with audiences in real time.

## ⚙️ My Technical Stack

**Backend:** .NET, Express.js  
**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL  
**Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, RESTful APIs, System Design  

I’m currently **open for both Backend and Frontend Developer roles** — ideally positions that allow me to contribute across systems while learning from real-world challenges.
